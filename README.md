Car Price Prediction â€“ Streamlit Web App

This project is a machine learning-based web application that predicts the selling price of a used car based on several input features such as the current market price, kilometers driven, car age, fuel type, seller type, transmission, and number of previous owners. The model was trained on a dataset of car listings and leverages a regression algorithm to generate accurate price estimates. Built using Streamlit, the app provides an interactive and user-friendly interface where users can input car details and get instant predictions. The project includes a trained model (car_price_model.pkl), a scaler (scaler.pkl) for preprocessing input features, and a requirements.txt file listing the necessary Python libraries. This app is ideal for users looking to estimate the resale value of a car quickly and intuitively.
This Streamlit web app predicts the selling price of a used car based on details like its age, kilometers driven, fuel type, transmission, ownership history, and more.
